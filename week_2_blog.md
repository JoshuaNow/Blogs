 ## Sequences: Lists, Strings, and Tuples
1. Today we learned how to use sequences [or arrays on other languanges as clint made sure we know lol]

2. The best way I can describe a sequence is a variable with multiple data types, pretty much any data type, can be stored in the sequence or pretty much a list.

3. The reading was on functions, which sound interesting to say the least, what I still don't under stand is the scope local or global and how it is determined in the function.

## Day 1 

This day was pretty cool and simple, we introduced ourselves to our class, getting a feel for what was to come and how it worked. We did learn though, we learned how to use git and upload files up repositories we made into GitHub. Which are not the same thing, *" Who knew.."* 



## Day 2 
We definitely picked up today really quick and we learned a lot. So I will be quick and breif about subjects. We learn some basic Python commands and got my first python repository that said it had python code . *woot woot*


1.Hello world . py - was just to show how the print command worked.

2. Numbers - just showed how to properly input numbers into Python so we wouldn't get errors.

3.  strings - how to write strings not just on one line. what concation was and what inturpulation ment . also learned %s in python.



```python
f = "pretty cool"
better_string = "hey this is %s, and I like it." %f
print(better_string)

```
4. Comparisons Conditions and Booleans


```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a == b)   #False
print(b > a)    #True
```


5.Variables - super simple
